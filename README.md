This code can be used to create tables 2, and appendix 6.

Testing_change_metircs_with_CommDyn_dataset
This code can be used to create tables 3, and figure 4.

rcommunity_simulating_communities.R
This is the function that needs to be run before simulating communities.

rcommunity_examples.R
This is additional examples detailing how the simulations work.

RAC_scenarios.R
This code can be run to get the simulated communities used in the paper.

Nutrient_Addition_Experiment_Example.R
This code can be used to create table 4, figures 5 and 6, and appendixes 7 and 8.
